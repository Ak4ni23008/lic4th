### **Calculations**

- The given circuit employs **nMOS transistors** with **180nm** technology.

- The total power consumption and supply voltage are given as:
  \[
  P = 1mW, \quad V_{dd} = 2V
  \]
  Using the power equation:
  \[
  P = V \times I
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  1 \times 10^{-3} = 2 \times I
  \]
  Solving for **I**:
  \[
  I = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3}}{2}
  \]
  Therefore, the **tail current** is:
  \[
  I_{ss} = 0.5mA
  \]

- Since the **differential amplifier** splits the current equally between both transistors:
  \[
  I_{D1} = I_{D2} = I_D
  \]
  \[
  I_D = \frac{I_{ss}}{2}
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  I_D = \frac{0.5mA}{2} = 0.25mA
  \]

- Given **source resistance (Rss)** is determined using:
  \[
  R_{ss} = \frac{V_p}{I_{ss}}
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  R_{ss} = \frac{0.4V}{0.5mA}
  \]
  \[
  R_{ss} = 800 \Omega
  \]

This method ensures that the calculations are clear, precise, and completely original. Let me know if you need further refinements! ðŸ˜Š
