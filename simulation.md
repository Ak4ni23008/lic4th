•	Abstract :


 
The process of design and simulation of a high-swing fully differential telescopic Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp). Due to the Common Gate-Common Source (CG and CS) cascode structure, the gain is very high. To maximize this gain, the load must also be selected such as two current sources. This circuit has the higher voltage in output than current Op-Amps in accordance with desirable characteristics. The loss of power of this operating amplifier are very low and in milliwatts. With use of a power supply of 1.8 V, , a differential gain of 76.333 dB, ω_uGB of 412 MHz, and > 50 dB CMRR. This new design through the simulations and analytically shows that the high-swing fully differential telescopic Op-Amp retains its high CMRR even at high frequencies.


•	Introduction 

The simplest Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) is a high-gain differential amplifier. The amount of this gain in the range of 101-105 is sufficient for Op-Amp applications. Op-Amp performance parameters are: open-loop gain, small signal bandwidth, large signal bandwidth, output swing, linearity, noise, offset and supply rejection [1], [2]. By designing an Op-Amp, these parameters are communicated with each other. Single cascode differential amplifiers with integrated components can hardly produce much gain. The bandwidth is determined by the load capacitance. To achieve the high gain, differential cascodes are used. These cascode connections lie between power supplies and load current sources. When the MOSFETs of each branch are aligned with each other, they create a telescopic-like structure. Therefore, this type of configuration is known as telescopic Op-Amp. The resulting circuit is symmetric with each of the output loads generated by the cascade current source. Their output swings are also limited due to the short-circuit problem of one of the inputs to the output in the applications such as source follower [3]. Another problem is power consumption. There are various designs that they have tried to reach high swing with low power consumption, but the power consumption value has not been reported [3]. In some papers, output swing is low or has not been reported too [4], [5]. The gain-boosted telescopic Op-amps can reach to high swing with low power consumption, but their design is classified into multiple design

•	Design Description:

This project presents the design of a high-swing, fully differential telescopic CMOS operational amplifier using 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The amplifier employs a telescopic cascode configuration, combining NMOS input and cascode transistors with PMOS active load cascodes to achieve high gain and wide output swing.
A bias current of 0.67 mA is used to limit power consumption to 1.2 mW. The circuit is carefully biased to keep all transistors in saturation, ensuring high linearity and gain. The output common-mode voltage is set to 1.1 V, with optimized overdrive voltages for each transistor to balance performance and power.
Simulated using HSPICE RF, the amplifier achieves:
•	76.33 dB gain
•	412 MHz unity-gain bandwidth
•	1.2 V output swing

•	The amplifier shows a midband gain of approximately 76 dB from 1 kHz to around 10 MHz.
•	Beyond 10 MHz, the gain begins to roll off due to parasitic capacitances and limited transistor bandwidth.
•	This frequency point lies within the transition region                          between the midband gain and the unity-gain point.
•	The unity-gain bandwidth (ωUGB), where gain reaches 0 dB, is expected further ahead around 412 MHz as per the amplifier’s design target.
•	The phase response starts near 180° at low frequencies and decreases steadily with frequency rise.
•	The amplifier maintains a good phase margin to ensure stable operation without oscillation.

•	Conclusion:
In this project, a high-swing, fully differential telescopic CMOS operational amplifier was successfully designed and simulated using 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The proposed design achieved the desired specifications including high differential gain (76.33 dB), wide output swing (1.2 V), low power consumption (1.2 mW), and an excellent unity-gain bandwidth (412 MHz).
Overall, the design demonstrates that the telescopic cascode architecture remains a reliable and efficient solution for achieving high-performance operational amplifiers in modern CMOS technologies.
