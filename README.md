Aim:To find dc opt point, gain using transient analysis and AC analysis .
Components: resistor, MOSFET, DC power supply.
Procedure:
 Do the circuit connection as shown.
Connect dc power supply to gate and drain terminal and connect source to ground .
Gate voltage supplied is 0.9v and Vdd is 1.8v .

DC ANALYSIS 

input voltage is 0.9v connected to gate terminal and VDD is 1.8v.

RD = 1Kohm

ID=55uA

To match id value we need to set the w/l value.

we obtained w/l ratio
