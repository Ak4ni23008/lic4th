Aim:To find dc opt point, gain using transient analysis and AC analysis .
Components: resistor, MOSFET, DC power supply.
Procedure:
 Do the circuit connection as shown.
Connect dc power supply to gate and drain terminal and connect source to ground .
Gate voltage supplied is 0.9v and Vdd is 1.8v .

DC analysis 

input voltage is 0.9v connected to gate terminal and VDD is 1.8v.

RD = 1Kohm

ID=55uA

To match id value we need to set the w/l value.

we obtained w/l ratio 490/300.

Transient analysis 

analysis used to observe chnages in v and i over time with respect to vin.

input voltage , change it to sine wave with dc offset 0.9v , amplitude 50mv and frequency of 1khz .

Gain=vout/vin

vout=1.79

vin=900mv

Av=2 (approximately)

Ac analysis 

Here we are analysing ckt with different values of frequency.

Select type of sweep to decade , 20 points per decade , start and end frequeny are 0.1 to 1T.
